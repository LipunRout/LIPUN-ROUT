👑 Coder by Passion | Developer by Choice | Dreamer by Default


🚀 Who Am I?
I'm a MERN stack developer with a punch of Python power and a Java backbone.
Currently rocking my MCA at GEC Autonomous, I mix design, logic, and automation to build stuff that just works — and looks damn good doing it.

🧠 What I Do:

💻 Build full-stack websites that breathe interactivity
🧪 Break things (professionally) using Selenium + Python
☁️ Tinker with Cloud & DevOps like a digital alchemist
📚 Create roadmaps that guide careers like GPS for dreams

🛠 My Arsenal:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind, Bootstrap
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB, Firebase
Languages: Java, Python, C, C++
Automation: Selenium (PyCharm), API Testing
Others: Git, GitHub, Docker (beginner), Postman
